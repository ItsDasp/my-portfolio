Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is a simple, clean, and fully responsive site built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries, just pure code.

## About

This portfolio is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and provide a way for you to connect with me. I built it from scratch to experiment with new ideas and to create a space that truly represents who I am as a developer.

- Smooth scrolling and typewriter effect on subtitles.
- Responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile.
