  "I'm Diego, a self-taught developer. I was born in Santiago, Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± on August 24, 2006. I've always been curious about coding and tech â€” probably because as a kid I was once told that messing with the computerâ€™s command prompt was dangerous, lol. My real journey started in 2018, motivated by the idea of creating a Discord bot. That first project was called 'Sakamoto'. It wasn't a huge or super complicated bot, but itâ€™s where it all began â€” where I started experimenting, learning, and figuring things out. Around 2019, I created 'Senko', another Discord bot, with more experience under my belt, and thatâ€™s the only project Iâ€™ve kept active for the longest time.";

  "Until mid-2020, all my knowledge was pure JavaScript, but I didnâ€™t want to get stuck there. So I started exploring more: learning TypeScript, some HTML, and CSS â€” basically completing the web dev toolkit, lol. Iâ€™ve always seen myself more as a back-end dev, so I picked up languages like LUA and Python. More recently, I learned React and Iâ€™m pretty comfortable with it. Iâ€™ve also started diving into Java and Iâ€™m still learning, plus Iâ€™ve been getting my hands on C++ and C#.";
